Using the single-line diagram shown, three study cases were created in DIgSILENT PowerFactory to evaluate feeder performance under different operating conditions.
In the Base Case Load Flow, the 11 kV slack/source supplies Bus 1, power is stepped down through T1 (11/0.415 kV, Delta–Wye), and the LV network at Bus 2 (0.415 kV) feeds mixed loads (Load A – PQ, Load B – ZIP, and Load C – Motor). 
The line/cable section between buses is represented with the given R–X and length, and the base case establishes the reference results for bus voltages, line/transformer loading, and total feeder losses. In the Peak Load Flow case, the same feeder is tested at maximum demand by increasing the connected load levels (and motor loading where applicable) to capture worst-case conditions such as higher voltage drop, higher current loading, and increased technical losses. Finally, the Optimized Case focuses on loss minimization and voltage improvement using operational and planning actions visible in the diagram: capacitor/VAR support placement on the LV bus (e.g., the 50 kVAr capacitor bank) to reduce reactive power flow and improve voltage, transformer tap adjustment (example shown as +2.5%) to regulate the LV voltage level, and feeder reconfiguration / load balancing (where applicable) to reduce overloads and shift power flow away from high-loss sections. 
Results from these three cases are compared using key indicators such as minimum bus voltage (p.u.), maximum element loading (%), and total real/reactive losses (kW/kVAr) to demonstrate the improvement achieved by the optimization steps.
