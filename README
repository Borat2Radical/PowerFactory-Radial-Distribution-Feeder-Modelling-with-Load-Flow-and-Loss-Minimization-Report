Modeling and Load Flow Analysis of a Radial Distribution Feeder with Loss Minimization using DIgSILENT PowerFactory.
This repository contains the DIgSILENT PowerFactory project files, input data, and exported results for modelling a radial distribution feeder and evaluating its performance using load flow analysis. 
The work includes feeder creation (buses, lines/cables, transformer, loads), defining study cases (base load / peak load), and implementing loss minimization strategies such as reactive power compensation, transformer tap setting, and feeder operational tuning. 
The repository also includes exported reports (voltage profile, line loading, loss summary) and supporting documentation.
