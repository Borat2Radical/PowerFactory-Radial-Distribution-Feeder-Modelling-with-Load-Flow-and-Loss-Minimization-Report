The radial distribution feeder was modelled in DIgSILENT PowerFactory using a single-line representation that includes the External Grid (slack/source), an 11/0.415 kV distribution transformer, downstream line/cable sections, and multiple LV load buses. 
The modelling workflow started by defining the project base settings (nominal system frequency, base quantities, and voltage levels) and then creating buses with correct nominal kV values for the HV and LV sides.
The External Grid element was configured as the slack bus to establish the system reference for voltage magnitude and angle, ensuring numerical stability of the load flow solution and providing the balancing power required to meet system demand plus losses.
Network topology was verified as strictly radial (no loops), and element connectivity (busbar terminals, cubicles, and connection points) was checked to avoid “floating” nodes that can lead to convergence errors or unrealistic results.

All feeder lines/cables were parameterized using their R–X (and optionally B) data and physical lengths so that PowerFactory computes voltage drop and loss accurately along each section.
Where line types were available, a library type was used (positive sequence impedance data), and where only measured/derived values were available, the line impedance was entered directly as Ohm/km (or per-unit, depending on project convention). 
Transformer modelling included rated MVA/kVA, vector group (e.g., Delta–Wye), short-circuit impedance (%Z), copper losses, and magnetizing branch settings .
For studies focused on distribution performance, the transformer tap changer can be represented as an OLTC or as a fixed tap setting; when OLTC is enabled, its control mode (voltage control target at LV bus, deadband, and step size) must be defined carefully to avoid unrealistic tap hunting or overcompensation. 
Equipment ratings and limits (thermal current limits for lines, MVA limits for transformer, voltage limits per bus) were explicitly set so that “loading (%)” and constraint violations are computed consistently and appear in the results.

Load representation was selected to match practical distribution analysis. PQ (constant power) loads were used where the demand is assumed relatively constant across voltage variation (typical for aggregated loads in planning studies). 
Where voltage dependency was required, a ZIP model (combination of constant impedance Z, constant current I, and constant power P portions) was applied to capture more realistic behavior under undervoltage conditions. 
For motor-type loads, an equivalent motor model or an aggregate induction motor representation can be used depending on the level of detail; in a steady-state load flow context, motors are commonly represented as a P–Q demand at the operating point or using a simplified motor element .
All loads were assigned power factor targets (lagging by default for typical distribution loads), and load scaling factors were created to generate consistent Base Case and Peak Case operating points without manually editing each load value. This approach improves repeatability, making the study reproducible and easy to extend to new cases.

Load flow studies were performed using PowerFactory’s steady-state solver (commonly Newton–Raphson for robustness), with solution tolerances and iteration limits selected to ensure convergence while avoiding excessive runtime.
A balanced, positive-sequence load flow is acceptable for first-level radial feeder analysis when the network is approximately balanced and the main focus is voltage drop and losses. However, if the feeder includes significant single-phase loading, phase imbalance, 
neutral effects, an unbalanced three-phase load flow should be used to capture phase-wise voltage deviation and neutral current. During setup, checks were performed to ensure each island has a defined slack/source, that voltage-controlled elements are not conflicting (e.g., OLTC plus capacitor control both fighting for the same voltage target),
and that initial conditions are reasonable. When convergence issues occur, they are typically addressed by validating connectivity, confirming load sign conventions, reducing overly aggressive controls, verifying transformer tap bounds, and using appropriate initial guess options.

Loss minimization was treated as an engineering improvement exercise rather than a purely mathematical optimization. The baseline losses were first quantified at both normal and peak loading, then the loss contribution of each line section was reviewed to identify high-loss segments (usually upstream sections carrying higher current). 
Since distribution losses scale approximately with I²R, strategies that reduce current—especially reactive current—give the biggest benefit. Accordingly, capacitor/VAR support was evaluated at the LV bus or near heavy load buses to supply reactive demand locally, reduce reactive power flow from the source, improve voltage profile, and decrease I²R losses. 
Tap changer adjustments were evaluated to correct undervoltage at critical buses; while taps do not directly “remove” losses, maintaining voltage closer to nominal can reduce current for constant power loads and improve operating margins. Where feasible, feeder reconfiguration or load balancing (shifting load to reduce loading on high-loss branches) was considered, with the caution that radial operation, protection coordination, and switching constraints must still be respected.

Result reporting focused on metrics that clearly prove system improvement and maintain compliance with operating limits. The primary outputs were the bus voltage profile in both kV and per-unit, line/transformer loading (%), and total feeder losses (kW and kVAr). These were captured for each study case (Base, Peak, and Optimized) and organized into tables for before–after comparison. Where section-wise loss information was required, a loss breakdown per feeder segment was exported so that the impact of reactive compensation and operational tuning can be traced to specific parts of the feeder. For GitHub reproducibility, result exports were stored in a dedicated exports/ folder and referenced in the documentation, ensuring that anyone opening the repository can verify the same KPIs without relying on screenshots alone.

Key assumptions used in this study include the steady-state nature of load flow (no transient switching or fault dynamics), simplified load aggregation (PQ/ZIP approximations), and idealized control behavior for capacitor banks or OLTC (if control automation is enabled). Harmonic distortion, flicker, and switching transients were not included unless a dedicated power quality or harmonic load flow study is added separately. Protection coordination, relay settings, and fault studies were considered out of scope for this particular load-flow-and-loss-focused repository, but the model structure supports extension into short-circuit and protection analysis. Finally, it is important to document parameter sources (utility standards, datasheets, typical impedance values, or derived measurements) because loss results are highly sensitive to line resistance, conductor type, and loading assumptions.
