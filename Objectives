1.Build a radial distribution feeder model in PowerFactory using realistic component parameters

2.Run load flow under different loading scenarios and observe voltage and loading constraints

3.Identify high-loss sections and weak buses (voltage drop locations)

4.Apply improvement actions to minimize technical losses while keeping voltages within limits

5.Export and document results as reports, plots, and comparison tables
